                        Why a website?

                <p class="text-justify">
                    In an internet-dominated age, one of the biggest and crucial steps in expanding a business is establishing an online presence.
                    Promoting portfolios, products and services couldn't get any easier than sharing your business address - your own URL.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Investing in a website may seem costly especially when you're just starting, but if you've chosen not to, the loss will definitely grow and will eventually outweigh how much you think you've saved,
                    most especially when competitors in the market have already taken the lead.

                    </mat-panel-title>
                </mat-expansion-panel-header>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    A lot of factors and variables can affect software development costs such as niche, scope, complexity, urgency, etc.
                    As such, we are unable to readily provide a concrete amount. However, we always assure our clients that our rates are very affordable.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    If you just need a starting cost to work on, we can provide you our base rates. However, these will still vary depending on your application's corresponding tier. You may refer to our <a href="#" class="zen-primary-link" routerLink="/pricing">Pricing</a> page.

                </mat-expansion-panel-header>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Our projects vary taking around a month at a minimum. This is to allocate enough time for optimization and testing, as we aim to deliver quality solutions with the least number of issues as possible. However, less complex applications i.e. sites with up to 3 static pages can sometimes be done in only 2-3 weeks.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Urgent projects will require more people in the project and shall be billed at an extra rate, which shall be disclosed to you prior to onboarding.

                        What is an MVP application?
                    </mat-panel-title>
                </mat-expansion-panel-header>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    An minimum viable product or MVP is a product version with a bare minimum set of features, just enough to solicit feedback from customers in the early stages of a product.
                    Most business owners often prefer these rather than paying for full-featured systems in one go to save from investing on unnecessary work which, at the end, may or may not be positively received by their end-users.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Any quotation we provide is usually for building MVP applications unless, otherwise, stated and/or requested by the client. Full-featured applications will differ significantly in cost and will be billed monthly.

                Yes, we're here to help build your business, so feel free to let us know what changed. We won't charge you unless the changes are signifcant enough to cause a major impact on the scope, complexity and/or the project's original target delivery but we will definitely inform you beforehand should it happen.

                    Our teams use project monitoring softwares such as <a href="https://asana.com/" class="zen-primary-link">Asana</a>. We will be providing you access to the project so you can view its progress in real-time.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    On top of that, we will also be sending you reports periodically on the project's status
                    along with any unforeseen challenges, should there be any that arose during development and could impact either your billing or the date of delivery.
                    Rest assured we don't make any major decisions without your approval.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">

                <p class="text-justify">
                    For MVP applications, we only require a <strong>down payment of 30%</strong> of the total development cost. The rest shall be billed to you upon delivery of the application. 
                    We will be sending you an invoice that shall detail the initial agreed cost and all additional charges, if any, for the changes that was agreed mid-development.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    For maintenance and long-term projects such as full-featured applications, we will be billing you on a monthly basis. However, if no maintenance work was requested for an entire month, we won't be billing you anything for that specific month.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Definitely none! Whatever amount agreed upon prior to development is fixed with no running cost and will be the exact amount we shall be billing you unless there are any major changes in scope, complexity and/or duration which you've requested during development.
                    In such a case, we will setup a recorded meeting to discuss all possible options and how it affects the overall cost. Any charges billed to you that has not been documented shall be waived.

                    </mat-panel-title>
                </mat-expansion-panel-header>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Yes, as all applications would. Over time, with the rapid updates in technology, software libraries and design trends along with evolving customer needs, every application will need to keep up. Otherwise, it would eventually look and feel outdated or worse, degrade in performance over time.

                </mat-expansion-panel-header>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    The amount that's been billed to you by this time was for the development of the application's MVP. We offer 3 months of post-development maintenance free of charge.
                    During such time, we shall no longer be doing any additional feature implementation and/or changes from what was originally agreed on.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Though we'd still be happy to help you further - work on new and awesome features on top of maintenance, but it shall be considered a new project and shall be charged separately at discounted rates.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    If you do not wish for us to do so, we want to help you with the transition so we shall be providing you all project-related credentials along with a technical documentation which could be used by the team who will be maintaining your application moving forward.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Yes, we are happy to! However, since the product was not designed and developed by us, we will first need to examine and assess the scope and complexity of the application, the business niche, as well as the technologies that was previously used.
                    These and the duration on which you want us to look after the application will affect our rates. As such, our published pricing range do not apply and cannot readily provide an estimate.
