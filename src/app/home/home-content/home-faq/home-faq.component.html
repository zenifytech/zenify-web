                Why a website?
            </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>

        <p class="text-justify">
            In the age of the Internet - a resource so widely used whether you're stationary or mobile no matter where you live - 
            it is our firm belief that one of the biggest and crucial step in expanding a business would be to establish an online presence so readily accessible by anyone.
            Promoting portfolios, products and services couldn't get easier than simply sharing a business address - a URL.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Investing in a website may seem costly especially when you're just starting, but we believe the loss would eventually be greater and will outweigh how much you think you've saved if you've chosen not to,
            most especially when competitors in the market have already taken the lead.

                How much are your rates for web applications?
            </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>

        <p class="text-justify">
            A lot of factors and variables could affect our rates such as the urgency of the project, nature of business, project scope, etc.
            As such, we are unable to provide a concrete amount. However, we can always assure our clients that our rates are affordable and reasonably priced.

                Where are you located?
            </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>

        <p class="text-justify">Our team is based in the Philippines. One of the main reasons why we are able to offer very affordable rates on software development.</p>

                How long will development usually take?
            </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>

        <p class="text-justify">
            At Zenify, we typically follow a standard delivery of 2 months. This is to allow enough time for optimization and testing, but duration will all depend on the business niche, as well as the scope and complexity of the system. All of which will be discussed and estimated pre-development.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            If the project is urgent, at the client's request, we can also deliver it earlier than our standard time, but shall incur extra charges which will be disclosed prior to finalization of costs.
            However, if the application is simple enough, we will be delivering it earlier free of charge.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            We also offer discounted rates for non-urgent projects beyond 4 months.

                How do I keep tabs on the overall status of the development?
            </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>

        <p class="text-justify">We will be sending your reports on what is currently being worked on, what's already been completed and the overall status of the project
            as well as any unforeseen challenges, should there be any, that arose during development that could impact either your billing or the date of delivery.
            We will always guarantee you that we won't make any major decisions on the application without your consent.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            We will be emailing you these reports periodically in the frequency of your choice. We will also provide you access to our Clients' hub for you to be able to check the status in real-time.

                Are there any hidden charges I should know about?
            </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>

        <p class="text-justify">
            No, the amount we have agreed at the start of the project will be the exact amount we will be billing you unless there will be any significant changes you've requested during development.
            In such a case, we will be discussing options with you and the changes to the final cost. Upon your approval, we will be billing you the newly defined cost upon completion.

                When will I be billed?
            </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>

        <p class="text-justify">
            Before starting the project, we will require a down payment of 30% of the final project cost. The rest shall be billed to you upon delivery of the application. 
            We will be sending you an invoice that would include the initial agreed cost as well as the additional charges, if any, for the changes that was agreed during development.
        </p>

                After the application has been built, will you also be doing maintenance?
            </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>

        <p class="text-justify">
            The cost we have billed you was for the development of the application. We will be offering you 2 months of maintenance post-development free of charge to fix whatever issues that may have been missed.
            During this time, we would no longer be doing some additional feature development and/or changes from what was originally agreed on.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            We would still be happy to help you further and take care of maintaining your application, as well as add any awesome features you'd like us to work on, but it shall be considered a new project and will incur new and separate charges.
        </p>

                I already have an existing application, do you offer maintenance services?
            </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>

        <p class="text-justify">
            Yes, we are happy to! However, since the product was not designed and developed by us, we will need to examine and assess the scope and complexity of the application, the business niche, as well as the technologies that was previously used.
            These and the duration on which you want us to look after the application will affect our rates. As such, our published pricing range may not apply.
